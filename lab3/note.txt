My cookie: 0x384e1de7459dacae

Level 0: Candle & Level 1: Sparkler
Just focus on the following points.
stack structure of function of test and getbuf:

address: growing to lower address

0x7fffffffbc38: address of variable 'local=0xdeadbeef', should be changed to cookie val
0x7fffffffbc40
0x7fffffffbc58: 0x400ef3 # return address of getbuf, should be changed to 0x4010c0 --address of smoke(same with fizz, 0x401070)
0x7fffffffbc50: 0x7fffffffbc80 # $rbp of test, do not need to be kept!
0x7fffffffbc48:
.
.
.
0x7fffffffbc20: rsp, also the start address of buf


Level 2: Firecracker

useful commands:
as -o bang_part.o bang_part.s
objdump -d bang_part.o > bang_part.disassembly

address of function bang: 0x401020
address of variable "global_value": 602308 <global_value>

address of variable "local": 0x7fffffffb1a8
value of ebp in function getbuf: 0x7fffffffb190
*(long*)ebp: 0x7fffffffb1c0, old ebp val
value of esp in function getbuf: 0x7fffffffb160, which is also the address of buf


Level 3: Dynamite
as -o dynamite_part.o dynamite_part.s
objdump -d dynamite_part.o > dynamite_part.disassemply

This time, $rbp of test is need to be kept: 0x7fffffffb1c0, stored in address 0x7fffffffb190
